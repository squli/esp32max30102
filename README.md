# Test task
We invite you to demonstrate your skills through a formal test task. Please implement firmware to control a couple of sensors via a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) interface. Ideally, the sensors should be a medical ones, but this is not a strict requirement. You can provide implementation with only one sensor, but keep in mind, that there will be several ones. You are free to choose the most suitable BLE host device for this task, such as the nRF52, ESP32, or any other device of your preference.

We will attempt to build this project and, if we have the necessary hardware, we will test it accordingly. You may use external libraries, but please be prepared to explain your choices during the review process. It would be great if you provide brief description of your project and prepare some presentation like for a weekly demo.

We wish you the best of luck with this task.
